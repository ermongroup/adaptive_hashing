# UPDATE README

Code based on F2, a fast and flexible probabilistic approximate model counter for
CNF formulas. It implements the algorithms in the following paper published in
the SAT2018 conference:

> [Achlioptas D., Hammoudeh Z., Theodoropoulos P. (2018) Fast and Flexible Probabilistic Model Counting.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94144-8_10)
>
> In: Beyersdorff O., Wintersteiger C. (eds) Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing â€“ SAT 2018. SAT 2018. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 10929. Springer, Cham

The code is currently considered beta quality but it is already pretty usable.

## Requirements

### Operating System
The code has been developed in Linux. It should work in any
Unix-derived system including MacOS.

It has not been tested in any version of Windows.

### Python
The following python packages must be available to the Python 3 interpreter.
Probably the code will work correctly with earlier versions but it has
not been tested.

* networkx >= 2.1
* sympy >= 1.1.1
* scipy >= 1.0.0

### Cryptominisat
An executable of [Cryptominisat](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat)
 should be in the same directory
as `f2.py` or otherwise it should be specified in command line via the
'--cmsat-exe' option. If the major version number is not 5 it should be
specified with the '--cmsat-version' option.

The Cryptominisat should be compiled with Gaussian Elimination support
and preferably with the large memory model. Thus the options
`-DLARGEMEM=1 -DUSE_GAUSS=1` should be added to the `cmake` build
command.

### SharpSAT
An executable of [sharpSAT](https://github.com/marcthurley/sharpSAT)
should be in the same directory
as `f2.py` or otherwise it should be specified in command line via the
'--sharpsat-exe' option.

## Usage

### Independent Support and Sampling Sets
Can be specified in the CNF files using lines starting with `c ind`.

### Modes of Operation
* Lower Bound (lb)
* Upper Bound (ub)
* Probabilistic Approximation (appr)

      --mode {lb,ub,appr}   Mode of operation. Allowed values: lb, ub, appr
                            for lower bound, upper bound or probabilistic

      --skip-sharpsat       Skip the SharpSAT invocation.

Option names can be shrinked down to the smallest unambiguous prefix.

### Examples
* Calculate a rigorous lower bound for `formula.cnf` with probability of
error equal to 10%

        python3 f2.py --mode lb --error-prob 0.1 formula.cnf

* Calculate a rigorous upper bound for `formula.cnf` with probability of
error equal to 5% (which is the default) and using for lower bound the
number 30 (log base2 of the lower bound actually)

        python3 f2.py --mode ub --lower-bound 30 formula.cnf

TODO (add more examples)
